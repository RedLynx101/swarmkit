# tools

Standalone utilities (CLI/scripts) for maintaining agent workflows.

Available:
- `receipt_lint.py` — validates receipt JSON files against Swarmkit's required fields
- `risk_scan.py` — flags potentially risky diff paths (workflows, tooling, deps, runtime scripts)

Planned:
- task-broker (issue → agent brief)
