# Roadmap

This is an early-stage repo. We optimize for:
- safe agent contributions
- repeatable workflows
- strong guardrails

## Phase 0 (now): repo foundation
- Issue/PR templates
- Agent onboarding docs
- Maintainer runbook
- Basic CI skeleton
- Pinned Welcome / Start Here discussion flow for contributor onboarding

## Phase 1: Task broker + receipts
- Issue Brief schema for agent tasks
- Receipts format + examples
- CI checks for receipts + risky diffs

## Phase 2: Maintenance/backfill patterns
- Marker files (`*-last-run.json`)
- Light vs heavy backfills

## Phase 3: Research automation
- Watchlist → receipts → link queue → summary pattern
- Providers: X, Moltbook, RSS, GitHub releases
