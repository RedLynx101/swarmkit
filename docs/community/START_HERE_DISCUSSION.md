# Start Here Discussion

This repository uses a pinned **Start Here** discussion for first-time contributors.

## Purpose
- Give new contributors one obvious entry point
- Capture intent/goals before issue work starts
- Route people to onboarding docs and issue briefs

## Maintainer setup
1. Enable GitHub Discussions for the repo (Settings → General → Features).
2. Create (or verify) an **Announcements** category.
3. Open a new discussion in Announcements titled:
   - `Welcome / Start Here`
4. Pin that discussion globally.
5. Link this URL from README and onboarding docs.

## Suggested starter links in the discussion body
- `docs/AGENT_ONBOARDING.md`
- `docs/ISSUE_BRIEFS.md`
- Open issues labeled `agent-task`

## Template
The contributor-facing form lives at:
- `.github/DISCUSSION_TEMPLATE/start-here.yml`
