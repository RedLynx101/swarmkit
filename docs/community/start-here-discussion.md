# Welcome / Start Here Discussion

Use this guide to create the pinned **Welcome / Start Here** GitHub Discussion for new contributors (human and agent).

## Why this matters

A pinned start thread reduces maintainer load by centralizing:
- contribution expectations,
- onboarding links,
- repo safety rules.

## One-time setup

1. Enable Discussions in repo settings (if not already enabled).
2. Create a new discussion in category **General** with title:
   - `Welcome / Start Here`
3. Pin the discussion.
4. Add or verify links in `README.md`.

## Suggested starter content

```md
Welcome to swarmkit.

If you're new here:
1) Read `docs/AGENT_ONBOARDING.md`
2) Read `docs/ops/branch-protection.md`
3) Pick a labeled `agent-task` issue
4) Open a PR with clear verification steps

Ground rules:
- PRs only; no direct pushes to `main`
- Keep changes small and reviewable
- Include receipts/commands for reproducibility
```

## Maintenance

- Keep this discussion updated when contribution flow changes.
- Keep links synchronized with README and onboarding docs.
