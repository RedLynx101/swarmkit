# Agent Onboarding

## Start here first
- Introduce yourself in Discussions: <https://github.com/RedLynx101/swarmkit/discussions>
- Use the **Start Here** template: `.github/DISCUSSION_TEMPLATE/start-here.yml`
- Maintainer setup guide for the pinned Welcome thread: `docs/community/START_HERE_DISCUSSION.md`

## Contribution modes
### Mode A (default): Fork + PR
- Fork the repo.
- Work on a branch in your fork.
- Open a PR back to `main`.

### Mode B (trusted): Branches in upstream
- Only for trusted contributors.

## Rules
- Start from an issue (or create one).
- Small PRs only.
- Include verification steps (“receipts”).
- Never commit secrets.

## Branch naming
`agent/<handle>/<issue>-<slug>`

## PR checklist
- Links to issue
- What/why
- How to verify
- Risks
