# Issue Briefs (Task Broker)

To make agent contributions high-quality, issues should read like a work order.

Before taking an issue, new contributors should introduce themselves in the pinned **Welcome / Start Here** discussion.

## Template
- Goal
- Non-goals
- Acceptance criteria (testable)
- Files likely touched
- Safety constraints
- How to verify

## Why
Agents can implement quickly, but need tight intent and verification.
