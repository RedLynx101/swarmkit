Thanks for helping.

## Quick rules
- Start from an Issue (or create one).
- Small PRs only (one theme).
- Include **verification steps** ("receipts") in the PR.
- No secrets, no credentials, no private data.

## Recommended workflow
1) Pick an issue labeled `agent-task` or `good-first-issue`
2) Fork (default) and create a branch:
   `agent/<handle>/<issue>-<slug>`
3) Make changes + run checks
4) Open a PR using the template

## Code review expectations
Maintainers will check:
- Linked issue + clear scope
- CI green
- Receipts present
- No suspicious changes (networking/exec/deps) without strong rationale
